bisquik
======= 
bisquik randomly samples a graph with a prescribed degree distribution.

It implements the algorithm from Bayati, Kim, and Saberi, 2010
Algorithmica 58(4):860-910 [doi:10.1007/s00453-009-9340-1](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00453-009-9340-1)


Usage
-----

    bisquik [options] degfile
    
    Generate a random sample of a graph with a prescribed degree 
    distribution.  The program reads the degrees in <degfile>
    and generates an asympotically uniform sample of a random graph
    with that same degree distribution.  If successful, the program
    outputs the edges of the graph to <degfile>.<k>.edges where
    <k> is the first integer such that <degfile>.<k>.edges does not
    exist.  
    
      -v, --verbose  make the program chattier
    
      -s, --stats  collect sampling statistics
        The statistics are written to <output>.stats
        
      -d PATH, --dir=PATH  change the output directory
        The default output name is <degfile>.<k>  Given PATH, 
        bisquik changes the path on <degfile> to PATH, 
        and searches for the first empty file with name 
        <PATH>/<degfile without path>.<k>.edges.  Changing the 
        output directory affects all other outputs as well.
        
      -o NAME, --output=NAME  the root output name
        The default output name is <degfile>.<k>  Given NAME, 
        bisquik searches for the first empty file with name 
        <NAME>.<k> just like the default behavior.  See --fixed 
        to avoid this behavior.
        
      -n COUNT, --samples=COUNT  produce COUNT samples
      
      -t COUNT, --trials=COUNT  perform COUNT trials for each sample 
        Each sample is not 
      
      -f NAME, --fixed=NAME  a fixed output name.
      
      --graphfile=NAME  an explicit graph filename for output
      
      --statsfile=NAME  an explicit statistics filename for output
          Using this option enables statistics collection
          
      -e, --expo  Sample edges with probability: exp(-di*dj/4m)*ri*rj
      
      -a, --approx  Sample edges with probability: (1-di*dj/4m)*ri*rj
          These are the probability used in the paper.
      
      --seed=<unsigned int>  If seed is 0, then the program is seeded
        based on the current time (the default).  
      
      -p <NVERTS>,<THETA>,<MAXDEG> --powerlaw=<NVERTS>,<THETA>,<MAXDEG>
        Ignore degfile and use a synthetically generated power-law
        degree distribution.
      
Degree File Format
------------------

The file format is textual and is a list of integers:
    
    File: Header\nDegreeList
    Header: <int:nverts>
    DegreeList: (<int:degree>\n)*nverts

For example, here is the degree sequence file for a triangle
with one extra node

    4
    2
    2
    3
    1
    
High level parameters
---------------------

There are three levels of sampling here:

i) samples - independent realizations of the prescribe degree graph
ii) trials - the number of repetitions of the Bayati-Kim-Saberi 
  algorithm until we generate a successful sample
iii) edge samples - the number of repetition of the fast edge sampling
  procedure before reverting to searching for an edge (slow)

for i in xrange(samples):
  for j in xrange(trials):
    success = true
    G = new_graph(degrees)
    while G.edges_remaining():
      for k in xrange(max_edge_samples):
        found = false
        if (G.sample_edge()): # try to find an edge quickly
          found = true
          break
      if not found:
        if G.still_valid(): # check if we made a mistake
          G.search_for_edge()
        else:
          success = false # if we did, quick this trial here
          break
    if success:
      G.write_graph()
      break # we don't need any other trials
  # move on to the next sample
        
      
Return value
------------

The return value of the program is 0 to indicate a successful run.
A negative return value indicates an error with the parameters.
Also, a positive return value indicates that not all requested
samples were generated.  The positive value is the number of
missing samples.
      
Statistics collection
---------------------

stats to collect:

<vi> <vj> <ri> <rj> <di> <dj> <nsamples> <search>

edge_prob is <ri>*<rj>*sample_prob/4m
search is <0> or <1>
